# üåê Inclusight ‚Äì Accessibility Analyzer

**Inclusight** is a full-stack web application that helps **website owners, developers, and accessibility advocates** evaluate the accessibility of any public website.

It uses **Lighthouse**, **axe-core**, and **Puppeteer** to check for accessibility issues such as:
- Low contrast text (difficult for people with color blindness or low vision)
- Poor font readability
- Missing alternative text for images
- Keyboard navigation issues
- And more‚Ä¶

The tool is designed to **empower developers to create more inclusive websites** for people with disabilities, including:
- **Color vision deficiencies**
- **Low vision**
- **Motor impairments** (keyboard-only navigation)
- **Cognitive impairments**

Inclusight provides:
- A **beautiful React frontend** (Tailwind CSS) for a modern user experience
- A **Node.js/Express backend** that runs the analysis
- **MongoDB** for storing analysis history
- **CSV report generation** for sharing and record-keeping
